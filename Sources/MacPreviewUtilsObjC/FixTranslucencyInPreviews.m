#if DEBUG

/*
This fixes SwiftUI previews not rendering translucent materials correctly by
swizzling a couple of properties on NSWindow.

Just drop into your project and add to the target being previewed (or something it links against).

Notice the #if DEBUG, so this code won't end up in release builds. It also checks for the
XCODE_RUNNING_FOR_PREVIEWS environment variable so that it won't affect regular debug builds of the app.
